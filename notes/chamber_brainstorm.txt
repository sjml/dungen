Want to be able to merge chambers
    - merge tags
    - do anything with attributes?
        - so far it's mostly "open" and "treasure"
        - plague is also there; easy to transfer
    - take all tiles out of their domain if it has one, add them to merging agent
    - same with disappearing chamber's region
        - after resolving encounter between agents, of course
    - unstore everything from disappearing chamber, store it in new chamber

    -- wait until after we've got agents interacting to worry about this
    - carve first, then merge? or check with each carving?
        - something like FATE, magma, or water needs to react quickly
