Want to be able to store and retrieve objects from individual chambers
    - change out the current "empty" mechanic
    - int attribute: chamberStorageAmount
    - string attributes: chamberStorage1, chamberStorage2, etc.
    - capacity? hmmm.

    - store item:
        - increment chamberStorageAmount
        - stick it in the next open string
    - remove item:
        - find it in the strings, remove it, shift all the others down
        - decrement chamberStorageAmount
    - after storing/adding
        - remove all tags labeled "storage" within chamber
        - go through strings, add that tag to lowest tile (piling up)
    - get stored items: list of strings

Want to be able to merge chambers
    - merge tags
    - do anything with attributes?
        - so far it's mostly "open" and "treasure"
        - plague is also there; easy to transfer
    - take all tiles out of their domain if it has one, add them to merging agent
    - same with disappearing chamber's region
        - after resolving encounter between agents, of course
    - unstore everything from disappearing chamber, store it in new chamber

    -- wait until after we've got agents interacting to worry about this
    - carve first, then merge? or check with each carving?
        - something like FATE, magma, or water needs to react quickly
