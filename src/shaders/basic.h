    Overview:

        Shader program 'basic':
            Get shader desc: basic_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: basic_vert
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_basic_vert_pos = 0
                Uniform block 'basic_uniforms':
                    C struct: basic_uniforms_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_basic_uniforms = 0
            Fragment shader: basic_frag


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader basic = sg_make_shader(basic_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'basic_vert':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_basic_vert_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'basic_uniforms':

        basic_uniforms_t basic_uniforms = {
            .color = ...;
            .matrix = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_basic_uniforms, &SG_RANGE(basic_uniforms));
