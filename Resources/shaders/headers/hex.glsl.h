    Overview:

        Shader program 'hex':
            Get shader desc: hex_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: hex_vert
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_hex_vert_hexPoint = 0
                    ATTR_hex_vert_worldPos = 1
                    ATTR_hex_vert_color = 2
                    ATTR_hex_vert_overlayColor = 3
            Fragment shader: hex_frag


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader hex = sg_make_shader(hex_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'hex_vert':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_hex_vert_hexPoint] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_hex_vert_worldPos] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_hex_vert_color] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_hex_vert_overlayColor] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]
