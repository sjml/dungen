These annotated glsl files are all processed into headers by sokol-shdc for consumption
by sokol_gfx. They aren't used directly, but the generated headers rather are compiled
into the executable.

Relevant script: ./buildscripts/regenerateShaders.sh
Relevant readme: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md
Generated headers: ./src/shaders/*.h
